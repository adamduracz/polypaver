  * Expressions with 
    * The operations +,-,*,/, abs, sqrt, exp <!--, sin, cos -->
    * Explicit **intervals** and **interval operations**
    * Definite **integrals** (with arbitrary expressions for endpoints)
    * Floating-point **rounded operations** (with adjustable precision)
  * Verification of **floating-point** [SPARK Ada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)) programs
    * Effective for procedures and functions with up to 4-6 floating-point variables
    * Specifications can contain interval operations and integrals
    * Arrays are not supported yet
  * Live graphical progress update for 2D problems

#### Planned:

  * Support for other elementary real functions
  * Integration with [SPARK 2014](http://www.spark-2014.org/)
  * Problems in TPTP format as used in [MetiTarski](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/)
  * Integration with symbolic theorem provers, SMT
  * Proofs checkable by a widely trusted theorem prover
